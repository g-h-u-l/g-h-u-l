# 👾 GHUL — Gaming Hardware Using Linux
**Linux engineer · Hardware tinkerer · Open-source advocate**

I build high-performance Linux systems, tools, and workflows for gamers, creators, and hardware enthusiasts.  
My focus: making Linux a *first-class gaming platform* — with real benchmarks, real hardware, and real engineering.
